              You thrive on giving preloved clothing a new lease of life and
              it&apos;s no doubt that you&apos;re called a swapaholic. Beyond
              fashion, it comes naturally for you to seek more
              environmentally-friendly transport and food alternatives.
              <br />
              <br />
              So what can you and I do to overturn the damage? It seems like
              such an uphill task but it all starts by each one of us committing
              to be more eco-friendly.It&apos;s up to all of us to try and make
              changes in the way we live. Change won&apos;t come abruptly, so
              just do whatever you can, and after a while, it will become a
              habit.

              Go Vintage
            </h3>

            <p>
              More than 2 million tons of clothing wind up in landfills each
              year. By adding a few vintage items to your wardrobe, you&apos;re
              keeping landfills a little less cluttered. You also reduce your
              carbon footprint, since new clothes involve a manufacturing
              process and then need to be transported to the store. Recycling
              and re-using vintage clothing means you are not only doing your
              bit to help the earth by discouraging the production of more
              throw-away fashion, but you are also getting a much better
              quality, unique and individual product at a better price.{" "}

            <h3 className="secondary justify-self-start align-self-start">
              Buy Local
            </h3>

            <p>
              From clothes to food, the closer to home these products are made
              and bought, the less carbon is created with their transportation.
              Not only that, but you&apos;ll be supporting the local economy
              which means that in time you&apos;ll likely have even more local
              items to choose from. If you support your local farmers' market,
              you're also supporting more low-scale food agriculture which tends
              to be more kind to the Earth.
            </p>

            <h3 className="secondary justify-self-start align-self-start">
              Reducing Packaging
            </h3>

            <p>
              Packaging takes a lot of energy, water and other natural resources
              to produce, and packaging waste pollutes our air, water and soil.
              Reduce and recycle your packaging waste as much as possible to
              minimise use of raw materials to produce packaging, reduce energy
              expenditure and emissions associated with the manufacture of
              packaging, and minimise waste sent to landfill. There are
              zero-waste shops where you buy unpackaged food. But you can also
              go to the supermarket, and make better choices by buying
              unpackaged fruit and vegetables, or opting for cans and cardboard
              that are widely recycled instead of plastic. So there are better
              choices that you can make in regular shops.

                Vintage Clothing 101 – How to Shop Oldies But Goodies

              <p className="w-80 align-self-start">
                Vintage clothing. Where to start? What was once a fairly niche
                way to buy clothes—at least in a fashion sense—is now a huge and
                multi-faceted industry that has redefined how many of us look at
                clothing. Shopping vintage provides an opportunity to find rare,
                unique, and high-quality pieces, as well as offering a more
                sustainable way to buy clothing often at affordable prices.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you&apos;ve been shopping vintage for a while, you will have
                undoubtedly picked up a few gems that have got you hooked. If
                you haven&apos;t—you may not have been looking in the right
                places, or in the right ways. If you&apos;re looking to start
                thrifting or vintage shopping regularly, we&apos;ve put together
                this primer on the fundamentals of vintage clothing.
